# smart-store-sowers

## Purpose  
Practice completing a business intelligence project for a client. 

## Goals
The overall objective of this goal is to identify the highest-value customers and understand their purchasing behavior. This helps targeted marketing efforts, enabling businesses to retain top customers, create loyalty programs, and provide personalized recommendations.

By determining which products are the most popular (based on sales volume or revenue), I can optimize inventory, increase marketing efforts for these products, and forecast future sales for these high-demand items.

Tracking sales growth over time helps businesses understand market trends and business performance. By identifying growth patterns, I can make adjustments in pricing, inventory, and marketing to sustain or accelerate growth.

Understanding purchasing behavior is key for creating effective personalized experiences and improving customer retention. By analyzing what customers buy and when, you can optimize product offerings and marketing strategies.

1. Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer. Understanding which customers contribute the most to overall sales can help businesses target their most valuable customers for loyalty programs or personalized marketing.
2. Identify the products with the highest number of units sold. This helps to determine which products are the best sellers in terms of volume, guiding inventory management and marketing strategies.
3. Calculate the total revenue generated by each product category. This helps in understanding which categories are driving the most revenue and which might need additional focus or promotion.
4. Identify the month with the lowest sales revenue. This can help the business plan promotions or special events during slower months to boost revenue.
5. Identify the products with the highest number of units sold. This helps to determine which products are the best sellers in terms of volume, guiding inventory management and marketing strategies.

## Step 1: New Project Setup
1. Initialize Repository: Create a new GitHub repository with this format **smart-store-sowers** with a default `README.md`.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine in the **Projects** folder.
3. Open the project folder in **VS Code**.

## Step 2: Add Essential Files
1. **.gitignore**  
   Add a `.gitignore` file to specify files and folders to exclude from version control. You can reference an existing `.gitignore` template for Python projects.
2. **requirements.txt**  
   This file lists all necessary packages for the project. Review and adjust it to include or exclude packages based on your projectâ€™s needs.
3. **README.md**  
   Edit README.md to record commands, process, and notes so far as the project progresses.
4. 5. This is good time to `git add .`, `git commit -m "Message"`, `git push -u origin main` files to GitHub

## Step 3: Create and Manage Virtual Environment
1. Run command `git pull` first, to make sure the current project contents are on the machine.
2. Windows PowerShell: `python -m venv .venv` to create a new .venv environment in the project repo.
3. Activate the Virtual Environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

## Step 4: Install Required Packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages at once OR use `py -m pip install` commands to add packages on the go (e.g. `py -m pip install pandas` or group installs `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn`)

## Step 5: Select Python Interpreter in VS Code
1. Ensure VS Code is set to use the .venv environment.
2. Open the command palette using (Windows) Ctrl + Shift + P.
3. Type "Python: Select Interpreter".
4. Choose the interpreter inside the .venv folder located in the project root directory.
5. This is good time to `git add .`, `git commit -m "Message"`, `git push -u origin main` files to GitHub

## Git Commands Reminders 
1. Add Changes: `git add .`
2. Commit Changes: 5. `git commit -m "Message"`
3. Push Changes to GitHub: `git commit -m "Message"`
4. Pull Latest Changes:  `git push -u origin main`
